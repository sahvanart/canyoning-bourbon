Sass files are provided. The \_custom.scss file contains the variables that will override bootstrap default customization. Node modules are missing though. In order to modify the project using Sass you'll need `sass` package, `bootsrap`, a free version of `fontawesome` and `autoprefixer`. Then you can type `npm run compile:sass` in a terminal, it will watch for your sass changes and generate automatically the associated css.
